# Generate the Android APK first for that client, then do the following below:
cordova plugin save

*revert all changes in package.json* (very important step)

cordova platform rm ios
cordova platform add ios

#If the iOS app crashes when Camera is used, go to the <company name>-Info.plist, located at the platform/ios/<app name>
# add the following tags after the "NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription" string tag
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app requires camera access to function properly.</string>
